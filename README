ski
------------------------------------------
Imagine you are skiing down an infinite slope, facing such hazards as
trees, ice, bare ground, and the man-eating Yeti! Unfortunately, you
have put your jet-powered skis on backwards, so you can't see ahead
where you are going; only behind where you have been.

Runtime requirements:
  python
